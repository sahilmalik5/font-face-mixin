Supports IE, Gecko, Webkit, Opera.\r\n \r\n## Examples and Instructions \r\n$name is required, name of your font like \"Ostwald\".\r\n$font-file-name is required using font-files('relative/location', 'format'). for best results use this order: woff, opentype/truetype, svg, It defines the name of your font file like oswald.bold-webfont without extension(.woff,.svg,.ttf etc...).\r\n$font-files is used to generate all the url's for the fonts having different extension.\r\n$eot is required by IE, and is a relative location of the eot file using \"#\".\r\n$weight shows if the font is bold, defaults to normal\r\n$style defaults to normal, might be also italic. Order of the includes matters, and it is: normal, bold, italic, bold+italic\r\n\r\n## Include Font Face Sass Mixin in your project \r\n    sass\r\n   // Import the mixins\r\n   @import \"font-face.scss\"\r\n\r\n   // Call Mixins\r\n   @include font-face ('oswaldbold','oswald.bold-webfont','#oswaldbold');\r\n   \r\n   @include font-face ('oswaldregular','oswald.regular-webfont','#oswaldregular');\r\n   \r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2015 Sahil Malik\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
